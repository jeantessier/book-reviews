I'm a big fan of the =[[http://xkcd.com/][xkcd]]= webcomic and a friend got me
this book.

You can read all the strips on the website, but the book had additional
scribbles and notes in the margins that give us a glimpse into the mind of their
author.  Very geeky, always accurate, and some are definitely NSFW.  Thoroughly
enjoyable and a great gift for your favorite geek.

The author also added all kinds of little puzzles around the strips for the
hard-core code breakers and problem solvers.  Some are really easy to decode,
like the one where each letter is replaced with its position in the alphabet 
(A%3D01, B%3D02, etc.) or using
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille][Braille]] patterns.  Others use 2D
barcodes that require more work to crack.
