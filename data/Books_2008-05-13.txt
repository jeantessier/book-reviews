This book seems the be the first one to come out on Guice.  It
is the best, because it is the only one.  Otherwise, it has quite a
few shortcomings.  For one thing, there is no index, making it
impossible to jump ahead to a section that might talk about a
particular subject.  For instance, I want to know how to Guicify
a WebWork application running in Tomcat, but without an index, I
cannot figure out where to start looking.

The lack of index proved frustrating again, later, when I wanted
to look up something I remembered reading, but couldn't remember
which chapter it was in.

Otherwise, it was a good, quick read.  The examples were very
helpful, if sometimes too simplistic.  The descriptions were very
focused and really cut to the chase.

And I never did find out how to Guicify a WebWork application
running in Tomcat, but the book did cover Struts 2 briefly.  I
guess I'll have to upgrade if I really want to use Guice.
