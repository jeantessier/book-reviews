The book is another collection of essays written by Umberto Eco for various
conferences.  The opening essay, _Inventing the Enemy_, is somewhat
approachable, though he does lay the anti-semitic descriptions rather thick.  By
the time I started the second essay, I was wondering if I had bitten more than I
could chew; a recurring possibility with Eco.

In the preface, Eco explains that each essay was an imposed subject for some
conference or journal article.  It shows in that most of them are rambling
thoughts with no clear conclusion.  They are fanciful intellectual explorations
that meander more than they enlighten.

---++ Inventing the Enemy (2008)

We often define ourselves by opposition to an "enemy", even creating an
imaginary one if there are no real enemies at hand.  We reuse the same elements
to describe this enemy and vilify them, whether the manufactured "enemy" is
Jews, women, Arabs, or any other group.

<blockquote>

Having an enemy is important not only to define our identity but also to provide
us with an obstacle against which to measure our system of values and, in
seeking to overcome it, to demonstrate our own worth.

Jean-Paul Sartre reduced this theme to its simplest form in his novel _No Exit_,
which I had to read when I was in high school.

---++ Absolute and Relative (2007)

A rather dense discussion of absolutism, relativism, and holistic thinking.  He
cleverly quotes classical and modern writers. Whatever it is we decide to
believe, there are objective truths in the world that won't be denied, such as
death and solid walls.

---++ The Beauty and the Flame (2008)

This essay explores the mystical allure of fire.

Fire and light take in various meanings across societies.  Celestial fire and
light was the divine essence to medieval people.  Fire was knowledge and craft
to the ancient Greeks, as illustrated in the myth of Hephaestos.  Terrestrial
fire was hell to the ancients.  Fire was transformation to alchemists.  Fire
consumes, reveals and is an agent of creation as well as destruction.
Ekpyrosis: everything comes from fire and will return to fire, as in the phrase:
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

---++ Treasure Hunting (2009, 2011)

European reliquaries are filled with hidden beauties.  It is faith that makes
the relic, not secular truth of its origins, proven by science or otherwise.
The political agendas of the faithful are revealed through the stories of these
relics.

There is a part of _[[http://amzn.com/0156029065][Baudolino]]_ that deals with
the manufacture of relics.

---++ Fermented Delights (2008)

Piero Camporesi loved words; the more rare and forgotten the better.  He also
loved food and putrefaction and lists.

---++ No Embryos in Paradise (2008)

When does human life begins?  St. Thomas Aquinas tackled the problem based on
when the soul enters the body to make a human being.  He had concepts of a
vegetative soul for plants, a sensitive soul for animals, and a rational soul
for humans.  The embryo acquires each of them in stages, each one corrupting and
then augmenting the previous one, in a similar process to how nutrients are
corrupted in the body before being incorporated into through metabolism.  Except
St. Thomas Aquinas predates our scientific understanding of chemistry, biology,
and metabolism.

---++ Hugo, H&eacute;las!: The Poetics of Excess

Victor Hugo's novel are not about a specific character, or about a specifc
event, for that matter.  Instead, he attempts to create an impression in the
reader's mind, through massive excesses and seemingly infinite lists, similar to
how Beethoven would weave a tapestry of sounds and melodies in his symphonies to
convey a feeling.  Ultimately, Hugo's characters are the forces of Fate and
Destiny themselves.

---++ Censorship and Silence (2009)

You can censor information by suppressing it, or by burying it with noise.  For
example, news channels will distract the viewers with an unending stream of
banal stories so they do not pay attention to the serious corruption stories.
Advertisement is another case where advertisers pile meaningless noises one on
top of the other; what matters is that you advertise your product, not so much
what you actually say about it.

We are so distracted by noise that we cannot think for ourselves anymore.  We
should therefore be mindful of silence as a way to promote better thinking.

---++ Imaginary Astronomies (2001, 2002)

People have used their imagination to fill gaps in their knowledge: about the
heavens, about the earth, etc.  They've also forged histories about them to
foster political agendas.  Prester John's letter helped spur European expansion
into Asia and Africa.

<blockquote>

Remember the greatness of those imaginary geographies and astronomies, and those
errors that often bore fruit.

---++ Living by Proverbs (2007)

An absurd piece of writing.  What if we took every silly proverb literally?  It
makes absolutely no sense, which is the point, and is only barely entertaining.
Many of the proverbs seem to come from English, so I'm curious what the original
text in Italian must have been like.  I'm sure some of these proverbs might have
existed in Latin and made their way into European languages.  But all of them?

---++ I Am Edmond Dant&egrave;s (2008)

Anagnorisis is a frequently used literary device that worked well for episodic
feuilleton novels.  It can be overused at times, but is still very powerful.
Anagnorisis is when the reader enjoys deceiving the characters.  Like Odysseus
coming back to Ithaca and tricking the suitors.  Double anagnorisis is when the
author deceives the reader, such that the reader was not aware of the real
identity of the character.  I can think of the White Wizard being revealed as
Gandalf in _The Lord of the Rings_ as an example, and extreme cases in movies
could be _Fight Club_ and _The Sixth Sense_.  Anagnorisis is also frequently
used in manga and anime, other serialized forms of story telling.

---++ Ulysses: That's All We Needed... (2009)

James Joyce, as seen by Italian commentators in the fascist years before World
War II.  They criticize him for not being true to what they considered the
formal form of the novel, of not being nationalistic enough, and accuse him of
being a Jew.  All typical characterizations of the _enemy_.

---++ Why the Island Is Never Found (2011)

Lost islands have long held people's fascination.  For a long time, difficulty
in determining longitude meant that islands were found then lost, misidentified,
confused.  This essay ties to the Eco's novel
_[[http://amzn.com/0156030373][The Island of the Day Before]]_.

---++ Thoughts on WikiLeaks (2010)

WikiLeaks showed that all Secret Services only repeat information in the public
domain.  Conspirators only believe what they already know.
