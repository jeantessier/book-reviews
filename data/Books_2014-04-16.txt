Kundera's latest book is a collection of short texts where he develops his
understanding of Modernism, across the arts in general, and in novels in
particular.  The result is a rather eclectic but interesting peek into Modernism
and some of its less famous proponents.

Each section as short enough that I could read each one in a single sitting and
write down my notes immediately after.

---++ The Painter's Brutal Gesture: On Francis Bacon

Early and mainstream modernists gained followers who helped define their vision.
Francis Bacon, being the last of the modernist painters, does not have such a
group that imposes a form.  He is free to draw inspiration from all of
Modernism.  His paintings cut to the core of their subject, without any
additional layers. He shows life as an accident, without any higher purpose.

---++ Novels, Existential Soundings

Different novels shed different lights on separate aspects of the human
experience: laughter (_The Idiot_), vanity, sex (Philip Roth), individuality
(as a nine year old), idylls (_Tworki_), living in the present with imperfect
memories, life as a continuation through generations
(_One Hundred Years of Solitude_).  Novels help us explore the human condition.

---++ Blacklists, or Divertimento in Homage to Anatole France

Each of us only knows a portion of a given artist's works and we form our
opinion based on that partial knowledge.  Therefore, it is very easy for two
persons to have completely different interpretations and appreciations for a
same artist.

The setting of a novel can mask its message if the reader closely identifies
with that setting (e.g. a Frenchman and the French Revolution).  Fleeting
opinions of a blacklisted artist is all based on incomplete information.

---++ The Dream of Total Heritage

As an art form develops, its possibilities narrow down as it gets more and more
precisely defined.  Then, an artist comes along who breaks with tradition and
reconnects with the original, total possibility of the art.  Witness Rabelais,
Beethoven, Xenakis, and Fuentes.  Either they claim ownership of their entire
art, or else they place themselves outside of it, above it.

---++ Beautiful Like a Multiple Encounter

Kundera comments on Modernist literature of Martinique and how it relates to
prior developments in the art of the novel.  It not only expands on European
Modernist tendencies, but taps into local oral traditions the way the early
European novel developed from its earlier oral tradition too.  It is not only
Caribbean meets Europe, but early novel meets modern novel.

---++ Elsewhere

Exile can be freeing for an artist, who is no longer bound by obligations to his
home nation, and not bound by their host nation either.  The artist's only
loyalty has to be to their art, and nothing else.  This can cause breaches in
friendships when expectations start to diverge.

As a Canadian and Qu&eacute;bec expatriate living in the United States, this
part resonated very strongly with me.  I am proud of my heritage, but I do not
feel beholden to it either.

---++ My First Love

Kundera grew up in the legacy of Janacek and better understands why he belongs
with Modernist composers, and not romantic nationalists.  Janacek was a late
bloomer and has a unique understanding of how nostalgia is how music expresses
old age.  This is in contrast to how old age is usually represented in visual
arts.  Janacek's isolation made it difficult of him to belong to an art movement
and be recognized.

---++ Forgetting Sch&ouml;nberg

Kundera deplores the loss of art for art's sake in Europe of the 20<sup>th</sup>
Century. Makers of films (Fellini), photographs (Brecht), music
(Sch&ouml;nberg), novels, poetry are being analyzed with a clinical coldness for
their intrinsic faults, not what they bring to their art and to the human
experience.

---++ The Skin: Malaparte's Archi-Novel

Malaparte gives a new form to the novel. He uses it to express his view of the
new Europe that emerged from the ashes of World War II.  His novels are less
formal than 19<sup>th</sup> Century novels, more realist than surrealists of the
early 20<sup>th</sup> Century. They capture the end of Europe, destroyed
internally by Germans and finished by _liberating_ Americans.
