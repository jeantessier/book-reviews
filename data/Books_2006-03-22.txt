My other favorite author.  Usually not an easy read, but you end
up less stupid for it.

The main character lost his memory and relives his childhood by
examining the litterature he was reading as a child in fascist
Italy: comic books, translated novels, fascist propaganda.  It is a
very good look at a fascinating world.  Later, when the main
character regains his memory, he takes stock of his life and looks
at how his life was shaped by patterns and events in his youth and
teenage years.

I was a little puzzled by the ending.  I will need to reflect
upon it a little while longer.  I think it ties to his appreciation
of Cyrano de Bergerac earlier in the book.  I guess that makes it
the most desireable ending one could have hoped for.

This book brought back memories.  Just as the main character is
revisiting his past, rediscovering his childhood based on what he
read at the time, I was also going through my childhood, the books
I was readings, and how they affected me.  Thank you, Mr. Eco, for
this stroll down memory lane.
