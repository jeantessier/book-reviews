After reading a few articles by [[http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/][DHH]] on
[[https://m.signalvnoise.com/@dhh][Medium]], I figured I'd look at his books.

This book is about both running an distributed organization and working for one.
Companies need to go after the best talent, wherever it is, and not limit
themselves to the local talent pool.  Employees need to look for the best
opportunities, wherever they are, and not limit themselves to local employers.
Today's technology can really make remote work happen.

Much like [[#Rework][Rework]], it reads like another collection of opinions,
delivered in rapid succession, with little connective tissue.  Don't get me
wrong, these opinions appeal are very appealing to me and I would love to put
them to the test.  I was just hoping for more depth.

Early in the book, when describing the downsides of office life and trying to
motivate people to try working remotely, a lot of the advice boils down to "if
something doesn't work for you, change it for another."  Whether it's an
employee, your job, your boss, you name it.  For many people, it is easier said
than done, especially of your have many constraints.

I liked the bit about becoming more productive by having fewer _M&Ms_.  That's
_meetings and managers_, not the candy.  It definitely brought me back to my
early days at Google where they had few managers on purpose and counted on
contributors to self-organize and self-manage and decide how to best get work
done.

When discussing hiring remote workers, they look for character and a proven
ability to do the work, and less for credentials.  They also referenced
_guerrilla hiring_ from Joel Spolsky: make sure the candidate is smart and gets
things done.  They put more importance of the cover letter and test project,
then on the resume, kinda like contacting.

There are times when the writing just becomes trite.  Like this passage:

<blockquote>

It won't be easy, but lots of things that are worth doing aren't easy.  It just
takes commitment, discipline, and, most important, faith that it's all going to
work out.

</blockquote>

Because of the lack of depth, a lot of the advice boils down to taking the
authors on faith.  Since they only have one data point to support their ideas,
this is a lot to ask for.
