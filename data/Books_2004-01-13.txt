A great essay by expert presenter Edward Tufte.  It's a quick
read (27 pages) and includes the Columbia Accident Investigation
Board criticism of NASA and its contractors' over-reliance on
PowerPoint.  You may think the author goes over the top at times,
but the book is still filled with good advice for doing good
presentations: focus on content and clearly show your data.  The
message you want to convey is in the narrative tying the bullet
points, not in the bullets themselves.
