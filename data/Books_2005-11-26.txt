The book was OK.  It is kinda strange, the first half is for
non-technical people, like business analysts and such, and teaches
them to organize tests and test data into tables and HTML pages.
Then, about half-way through, it finally starts to address the
technical issues regarding how you realize those tables with
supporting Java code.  The last few chapters go into more details
about the architecture of [[http://fit.c2.com/][FIT]] and
the flow between some of the pieces.  The book talks a lot about
FIT and much less about [[http://fitnesse.org/][FitNesse]].

It so happens that I saw a presentation by Rick Mugridge on
2006&nbsp;/&nbsp;02&nbsp;/&nbsp;09.  He spent most of the time
extolling the virtues of testing.  I would have liked to get more
details about how FIT is implemented and the lifecycle of various
objects.  I guess it wasn't that kind of talk.

It is not my favorite book of all times, but it is the only one
on FIT at this time.
