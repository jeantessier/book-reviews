I hesitated between getting this book or
[Pragmatic Version Control Using Git](http://amzn.com/1934356158), but a
colleague recommended against the latter.

I'm not going to read it from cover to cover, but it's already been very helpful
with sharing branches via an authoritative repository and interacting with
Subversion.  So far, the explanations are clear and the examples are brief and
to the point.

It was very helpful in dealing with Subversion.  I'm able to sync up with the
Subversion repository at work, work in my Git branches, and commit changes back
to the repo, without the rest of the team having to worry about it.

I also tried to keep both the Subversion and Git repos for
[Dependency Finder](https://dependencyfinder.jeantessier.com/) up to date, but
that has proven too difficult.  I wanted to use the Git repo as the canonical
code repository and have the Subversion repo mirror it, but I couldn't keep my
local Git repository up to snuff on both of them.  That's ok, I'll just drop the
Subversion support from the project, that's all.  :-)
