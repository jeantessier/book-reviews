Really good follow up to [[MartinFowler.html][Martin Fowler]]'s
[[http://amzn.com/0201485672][Refactoring]].

Refactorings was about small, self-sufficient transformations.
Here, Kerievsky starts composing them together into larger
transformations to help you take existing code to, toward, or away
from patterns.  The goal is not to end up with one pattern or
the other, but instead finding ways to improve software little by
little.  It is the journey that counts, not so much the
destination.  This book makes a good bridge between agile methods
and design patterns, keeping today's work in focus and keeping
things simple but not loosing sight of the final goal.

I really liked the reference to _design debt_.  Whenever
you take a shortcut during development, you incur design debt.  A
little debt can help you get things done, but you need to repay it
before it becomes unmanageable.  Just like a credit card.  This
metaphor apparently works very well with management.
