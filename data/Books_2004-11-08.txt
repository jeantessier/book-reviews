Two authors for whom I have immense respect and a foreword by Tom DeMarco.  I
finally got around to reading this one.  I delayed because the other XP books
already covered the planning game as far as I'd care.  But hopefully these
authors can make it interesting still.

I was pleasantly surprised that something apparently so simple as the planning
game could have almost infinite subtleties.  The authors have streamlined it
somewhat but the original intent stays.  Divide the work into manageable chunks
and let technical people make the technical calls and the business people 
(customer) make the business calls.  This is not only when to schedule stories,
but when to split them and actually when they are done.  Well worth the small
investment in time.

Incidentally, I met Kent Beck at a local event the day after I finished reading
this book, on 2004-11-17, and I got him to sign my copy.

_Update_: I met Martin Fowler at a local event on 2010-05-12 and I got him to
sign my copy too.  Two for two.
