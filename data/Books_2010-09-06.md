Amazing pictures of objects in the Solar System, from the Nasa archives.  This
is more of a picture book, really.  It's more like I'm lazily looking through it
than actual reading.

I read about this book, and the
[matching exposition](http://www.sites.si.edu/exhibitions/exhibits/beyond/main.htm)
in an article in the New York Times.  The pictures on the website were
breath-taking, so I ordered the book.  Some of them are pictures of the Earth
taken from orbit, kinda like those of
[@Astro_Soichi](http://blog.summerwind.jp/special/astro_soichi/) on Twitter.
Others are from other planets and moons, taken by space probes, some with false
color.  The writer worked with astronomers and astroscientists to ensure his
false coloring was as close as possible to reality.
