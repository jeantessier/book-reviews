I'm reading the Pick Axe as part of learning Ruby for my new
language for 2008.  I'm off to a great start.  The language has
some really cool features and the author is very engaging.

Ruby's blocks is a very cool feature.  And it has
`-p` and `-i` switches just like Perl!  But
support for web apps goes back to CGI (at least in this book).
