Very good intro to unit testing.  Talks at great length about
the need for tests and the advantages of designing for testability.
It has a very nice tutorial on using JUnit and even briefly
mentions the use of mock objects.

It is filled with very good pieces of advice.  Many of them are
arranged into catchy mnemonics.  But they often feel forced and
some are so long that it becomes hard to recall what they stand
for.  This reminded me of a similar device that I keep hearing:
DRY - _Don't Repeat Yourself_.  It's about removing code
duplication, but everytime I see "DRY", it takes me a while to
remember what it's about.  So I try not to rely on mnemonics too
much.

Pretty much everything it says I had already gathered from
various other sources.  Martin Fowler's books, Software Development
magazine, Bob Martin's writings, etc.  It is nice to have it all
neatly summarized in one place, but it was all a little too
entry-level for me.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who
was not test-infected yet, though.

Very much like the authors' other book,
[_The Pragmatic Programmer_](http://amzn.com/020161622X).
I think DRY more or less originated in that book, actually.
