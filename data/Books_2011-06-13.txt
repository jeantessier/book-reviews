I really liked Uncle Bob's [[#Clean%5FCode][Clean Code]], and I thought
this would be aimed in the same direction of how to produce code in a way that
is enjoyable.  But it has more to do with Uncle Bob's vision of software
engineering as a profession.  He presents the attitudes and behaviors that he
feels are part of a professional software engineer's ethos.

One important aspect deals with commitments.  They form the basis of the
relationship between engineer and _client_, whether the engineer is a consultant
or an employee, in which case the _client_ is the business manager.  Commitments
create expectations and each side usually understands things differently.  A
professional understands this potential for misunderstanding and makes sure
everyone is on the same page.  This includes avoiding to commit to goals that
cannot be achieved, and doing everything to deliver on what was committed to.
The professional also has a duty to work with the _client_ to find a goal that
is achievable and serves the business.

Another important is handling pressure.  A professional relies on a set of best
practices in his everyday work and they should not abandon them the going gets
tough.  If these practices represent the best way that the engineer knows how to
work, then they should be that much more important when the project is having
difficulties.

The book ends with with Uncle Bob's manifesto for his vision of the software
craftsmanship movement.  When I say I'm a software craftsman, I care mostly
about workmanship and a certain creativity.  It's more about a state of mind,
really.  The Software Craftsmanship movement, with capitals, as described by
Uncle Bob and others, cares a lot about methods of training and apprenticeships.
It's more about external relationships.

Overall, the books has many interesting anecdotes about Uncle Bob and his
career, but little that is broadly applicable beyond that.
