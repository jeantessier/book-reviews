The ultimate reference for [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/][Ruby]] is still
[[https://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0][The Pickaxe]], but
it can be a little dry.  _The Well-Grounded Rubyist_ does a great job of walking
the reader though all the parts of the language, pointing out tricky areas along
the way.  It is very pragmatic and, well, _grounded_.

One nitpick is that at one point, the authors don't lean hard enough on the
"is a" relationship to decide whether to use inheritance or mix-in.  These two
composition methods are more than just about how an object locates its method,
it's also about others' expectations for a reference to an object.
