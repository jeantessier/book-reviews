Short and to the point.

Orwell shows again his theory of revolutions where the middle class 
(pigs) harness the lower class (other animals) to overthrow the upper
class (humans), but only to put themselves as the new upper class.  For
the lower class, nothing changes.  Orwell will expound further on this
principle in [[http://amzn.com/0452284236][Nineteen Eighty-Four]].

It is quite obvious that Napoleon refers to Stalin and Snowball to
Trotsky, but I wonder if Orwell was thinking of anyone else in
particular with other characters like Squealer or Boxer or Minimus, or
Benjamin.  Most of the other named characters are most likely just
generic proles.  But Benjamin with his long memory and Boxer with his
unwavering devotion to Napoleon stand out from the crowd and could very
well refer to proeminent participants of the Communist Revolution.

confirms and expands on my initial thoughts.

I like how right from day one, Napoleon is already scheming and
doing things behind the backs of the other animals, such as the
business with the milk.  He is also very quick to get the pigs
preferential treatment on the grounds that their work is so much more
important than anybody else's.  Right from the start, the other animals
didn't stand a chance.

In this book, Orwell shows how the Revolution's transition happens
and how the new status quo is achieved.  In Nineteen Eighty-Four, he
will show how this status quo is maintained, at least for a while.
