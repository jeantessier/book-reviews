MEAN ties the latest web development technologies together, the way LAMP tied
the early open source stack, years ago.  This book should be a decent intro to
the key players.

It starts by building a server-side template application using
[[http://expressjs.com/][Express]].  This was familiar territory for me.  The
server fetches data from the database, uses it to populate an HTML template, and
returns this HTML to the browser.  It then proceeds to build some of the
functionality as a REST API.  This last part felt a little forced, when you
consider it by itself, but it makes sense if you are going to move to a
_single page application_ model later on, which the book does using
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]].

The book covers just enough of each technology to get through the sample
application.  It's not quite enough for me to start doing _my thing_ with them,
but it is a solid starting point.  There is still a lot of ancillary material to
look at.  For instance, the Mongo schema shows how to embed subdocuments, but
not how to connect together different top-level documents, either one-to-one or
one-to-many or many-to-many.

I like that the book is doing its best to promote the coding style of its user
community (as far as I can tell).  This is particularly evident in the
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] code, where the official documentation
recommends a coding style that is quite different from what is widespread in the
community.  I find this style much easier to follow and work with.  I got quite
stuck after reading [[Books.html#AngularJS%5Fin%5FAction][AngularJS in Action]] with
an app that had an infinite loop and I was only able to fix it after I
refactored the code to make it closer to what is in this book.

I also really appreciated the parts where they show you how to host your
application for free on [[https://heroku.com/][Heroku]] and
[[https://mlab.com/][mLab]] (formerly MongoLab).
