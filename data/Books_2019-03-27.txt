Following
_[[#The%5FChildren%5Fof%5FHurin][The Children of H&uacute;rin]]_ and
_[[#Beren%5Fand%5FLuthien][Beren and L&uacute;thien]]_, Christopher Tolkien
pulls out all the Gondolin materials, along with the story of Tuor, son of Huor,
and puts them under one set of covers.

Once again, I appreciated the writing style that suggests old heroic tales and
myths.  The archaisms didn't give me too much trouble and contributed to the
atmosphere of myth.

Compared to the material in _[[http://amzn.com/0618391118][The Silmarillion]]_,
Tuor's travel to Gondolin and the attack on Gondolin are much more fleshed out.
I was already familiar with the longer tellings from my other Tolkien books, so
there were fewer surprises for me than with the other stories of T&uacute;rin
and Beren and Luthien.  But it was very enjoyable nonetheless.
