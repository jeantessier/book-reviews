From the reviews, this books sounds a bit controversial and rubbing against the
accepted wisdom.  To be read with a dose of critical judgement.  I like to
challenge my assumptions and consider alternatives, but that doesn't
automatically make them right.

The book's premise is that humans are not naturally monogamous.  Monogamy was
introduced when we discovered agriculture.  Prior to that, our hunter-forager
ancestors had no notion of property and shared everything.

In The Naked Ape, Desmond Morris specifically ignored primitive societies.  In
order to study humans, he focuses on their dominant representation.  In his
view, primitive societies must have had some defect or other that limited their
expansion.  Not knowing what these defect might be, he abstains from including
them so he does not taint his data.

The authors of Sex at Dawn take a different approach.  To them, these primitive
hunter-foragers can give us a glimpse of what our ancestors might have been
like.  They complement their approach by looking at our closest relatives in the
animal kingdom: chimps but even more so bonobos.  The picture that emerges is
quite different from the mainstream vision we inherited from Hobbes in 1651,
where human life is <em>solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short</em>, and
Malthus in 1798 where overpopulation and famine are unavoidable.  Instead, they
point at hunter-forager societies that live in equilibrium with their
environment, share resources, and have a mostly peaceful existence.

By combining data on bonobos from biologists, on primitive societies from
anthropologists, and on modern sexual behavior from psychologists, they raise
the possibility that homo sapiens spent most of their evolutionary history in
small tightly knit groups where both men and women had multiple sexual partners
and no hard-fixed patterns.  They shared everything, even of themselves, and
child rearing too.  When we discovered agriculture and property became
important, this is when we tried to force ourselves in monogamous relationships
and the nuclear family model.  The tension between the demands of monogamy and
our looser evolutionary attitude towards sex would be at the root of all our
contemporary problems.

They don't go as far as recommending that we all go and start sleeping around.
But understanding what drives our nature, refined through hundreds of thousands
of years of evolution, can help us be honest about ourselves and learn to live
without the guilt.

All the material in the book made a lot of sense and much of it deserves further
looking into.  While they suspect bias in many other authors, it is not clear
that they didn't have their own bias too.  Some reactionary backlash is to be
expected.  I didn't care much for their writing style.  All the snide sarcastic
remarks and juvenile retorts made it look like is was written by a pair of
teenagers.  As if!

And, I learned a new word:

On 2015-05-19, I came upon this article in The Guardian where
[[http://gu.com/p/4926j/sbl][Mark Dyble of University College London published a study on sexual equality]]
that reinforces many of the conclusions of Ryan and Jeth&aacute;.  The Guardian
article highlights many points from both the sex contract and the fierce
egalitarianism points of view.  The article was a good summary of how the debate
has been going over the past 200 years without picking a side.
