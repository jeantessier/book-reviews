We are using [[http://grails.org/][Grails]] at work.  I am using this book as a
reference, looking up topics as needed and leafing through it to get a general
feeling for the language.  Groovy is a lot like Ruby, but with a syntax that is
much closer to Java.

I was looking up the =-p= and =-n= options to write scripts for processing input
files, and I was annoyed that there was no exhaustive list of the resources
available to my script as it processes lines.  The book mentions =line=, which
holds the current line, and =count= that counts lines read so far, but what else
is there?  How about the current filename?  Or the line number within the
current input file?  I had to dig through the source code for Groovy to find out
that =line= and =count= were all that there was.

There is a [[http://manning.com/koenig2/][second edition]] planned for middle of
2010.  You can get early access copies from the publisher, for a price, as part
of the [[http://manning.com/about/meap.html][Manning Early Access Program]].

The chapter on database support via JDBC shows the massive support for database
operations using dynamic features of the language and closures.

The support for XML and HTML using builders is also very promising.

Between this book and the
[[http://groovy.codehaus.org/Documentation][online documentation]], I have found
answers to almost all my questions.
