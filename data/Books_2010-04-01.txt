Health and nutrition from a college professor that has been studying the field
for the past 30 years.  Now that I work at [[http://shopwell.com/][ShopWell]], my
aunt thought it might interest me.

It is very well written.  The author is very knowledgeable and has worked in this
field for over 30 years.  His style is clear and concise, free of technical
jargon and very approachable by the lay person.  He talks about the major impact
of getting enough sleep on the metabolism.  He prones aiming to eat for you
health and to recognize your body's signals that your not hungry any more, and
your weight will take care of itself.  Diets where you always fell hungry don't
work because the body fights back and you end up regaining the lost weight, and
then some.

Well worth reading, if you can read French.  :-)
