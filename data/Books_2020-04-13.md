I just finished watching the
[2019 miniseries based on book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose_(miniseries))
and I re-read a few bits to compare the adaptation to the source material.  I
also compared both of them with the
[1986 movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose_(film)).

This was Eco's first novel.  He was 48 years old when he started writing novels.
I read somewhere that he was growing dissatisfied with his contemporary novels
and that the only way he was going to get a novel to his liking was if he wrote
it himself.  I also read that it is his least liked of his novels.  It is the
most straightforward, the least ambiguous, the most true to form, and I believe
that is why he preferred his later novels, which tried to push the boundaries of
the art and explored the meaning of _meaning_.

The first time I read this book, I was stumped by the sections in latin.  This
time around, I was able to get a general sense of what they were saying.  I
cannot read Italian, but it was interesting to compare the English and French
translations.

Both the movie and the miniseries manage to save the girl, in the end.  The book
is more pragmatic.  Remigio, Salvatore, and the girl leave the abbey with Gui.
We don't get to witness their deaths, but it is a certainty at that point.

The movie conveys the spirit of the novel very well.  It drops many elements,
but that is necessary because of the nature of the medium.  It focuses sharply
on the  murder mystery aspect and leaves the other aspects as background
decorations.  The miniseries added some filler subplots to make the story more
palatable to today's audiences, but it was also able to lift larger chunks of
dialogue straight from the book, fleshing out the characters a little more.
