This update brings it up to [[http://grails.org/][Grails]] 2.3.7.  Between final
edits and actual publication, Grails is now on version 2.4.2 and some people are
already pointing out incompatibilities.

We're still using Grails 1.3.7 at work, so I got to read about all the cool new
things in Grails 2 without being able to use any of them.  And there is plenty
to get excited about!  Just about every chapter brought in some new piece that
made me wish I could use it in my day-to-day job.

The book itself was much better put together than the first edition.  The
examples flow better from chapter to chapter and I didn't find any
inconsistencies.

The thing that impressed me the most was how they use
[[https://code.google.com/p/spock/][Spock]] for all their testing.  It makes the
tests much more readable and possibly much easier to manage.  I remember using
[[http://rspec.info/][RSpec]] with
[[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]], and Spock brings the same
expressiveness to Grails.  It still supports JUnit-based tests from before, so
you don't have to rewrite all your tests when upgrading a project, but you
should definitely switch to it for any new tests.

The new =where= queries are much more flexible than the old =findAllBy...=
dynamic queries.  Since they use AST transforms, they are much more flexible and
can work beyond strictly SQL-based data stores.  They are also much easier to
test, not requiring integration tests for anything beyond trivial queries.

The chapter on Platform Core and pub/sub messaging showed me how large chunks of
code that I've written are now baked in, for all intents and purposes.  I used
Spring Events to build an event-based architecture, but the event in Platform
Core are much better integrated and require a minimum of code.  And moving from
there to distributed events (JMS-based or otherwise) is also now trivial to add
to any application.

Caching is now as simple as putting a few annotations here and there.  Much
better than an intrusive service that needs to be wired by hand everywhere it's
needed.

The authors did a good job of showing how to include the latest technologies
into a Grails application.  [[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]],
[[http://redis.io/][Redis]],
[[http://www.mongodb.org/][MongoDB]], and
[[http://www.neo4j.org/][Neo4j]] all make guest appearances.  Everything you
need to build a cutting edge app.
