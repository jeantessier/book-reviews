<span class="newthought">Note:</span> I waited two years before writing my
comments.  I don't remember much anymore.

The book was pretty good, very practical, steeped in the author's extensive
experience.  The presentation style was very approachable and lively.

Someone once said that Scrum was just the planning game from eXtreme
Programming.  It definitely is fairly simple to implement.  It focuses on the
communication between the development team and the project stakeholders and
leaves the developers free to work however they see fit.
