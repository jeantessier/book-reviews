The last book by Umberto Eco, who passed away on 2016-02-19.  He used all of his
tricks in making this one.  From the opening, where the narrator believes
someone was in his apartment while he was asleep, like in
_[[#The%5FPrague%5FCemetery][The Prague Cemetery]]_, to the end where the
narrator's girlfriend debunks his crazy conspiracy theories using common sense,
like in _[[http://amzn.com/0151327653][Foucault's Pendulum]]_.  He even manages
to squeeze in a paragraph in the style of his article
_[[#Inventing%5Fthe%5FEnemy][Living by Proverbs]]_.

True to Eco's style, the novel operates at multiple levels.

The first chapter introduces a narrator whose memory is unreliable.  Most of the
novel is told in a long flashback.  But since his memory is unreliable, how much
can we trust what he is telling us?

The main device of the novel is a newspaper that reports on past events as if
they had just happened.  It uses hindsight on those events to make _predictions_
that will have turn out to be true, making it look like the newspaper had
foresight, when it was just hindsight.  As a proof of concept, they invent
issues from one year prior that hint at what developed in the year since.  Now,
the novel itself is set in 1992 but was published in 2015.  Does it try to be
prophetic about the impact that events in 1992 would have in the following 20+
years?  I'm not familiar enough with Italian politics to answer this.

In chapter two, we learn the narrator, Colonna, is "fifty or so" years old in
1992.  Eco himself was born in 1932 and was 60 in 1992.  They are both from
Northern Italy and studied literature in college.  Colonna could work as a proxy
for the author, much like the protagonist in
_[[#La%5Fmisteriosa%5Ffiamma%5Fdella%5Fregina%5FLoana][The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana]]_.

One of the themes is how the media are manipulating public opinion for purely
capitalistic reasons.  It foreshadows the commercialization of news departments
in the years since 1992.  Eco uses these moments to show how writers can
manipulate the mind of their readers and create different effects with the words
they choose to use or not to use.  This is another literary concept that is dear
to Eco.

<blockquote>

It's not the news that makes the newspaper, but the newspaper that makes the
news.

</blockquote>

This theme is closely related to what Eco explored in
_[[http://amzn.com/0156029065][Baudolino]]_, where the main character believes
he can manufacture reality simply by inventing it in his mind.  If a lie is
repeated often enough, people can start believing it is true.

Another theme deals with hermetic knowledge: the idea that all things are
related and you can deduce a relationship between two things by looking at two
other, separate things.  As secret societies develop to protect some secret
knowledge, someone with the right hermetic knowledge might be able to piece
together the secret by gathering and analyzing other pieces of evidence.  This
was the central theme of _Foucault's Pendulum_; and that whether or not the
secret is real does not matter, as long as there are people who believe in it
and will do anything to defend them.

<blockquote>

Everything always fits with everything else, you just have to know how to read
the coffee grounds.

</blockquote>

Eco doesn't believe in hermetic knowledge, but it makes great fodder for
conspiracy theories.  And those make good stories.

An interesting subplot revolves around how can one person know what another
person is experiencing?  The communicator has a mental model in their head and
sends messages to transfer that model into their targets' head.  Maia's
character keeps sending messages that are misinterpreted, leading others to
think she might be autistic, unable to understand that someone else might be
thinking something different from her.  As her relationship with Colonna
develops, the two of them "think what the other thinks", meaning their mental
models are more in sync and require less messaging to communicate.

One last quote:

<blockquote>

the pleasures of erudition are reserved for losers.

<footer>page 9</footer>
</blockquote>

Colonna doesn't have any achievements that extend beyond his person, so he
considers himself a loser.  He takes pleasure in intellectual pursuits, I
suspect much like Eco himself did.  By the end of the novel, Colonna and Maia
have resolved themselves to an ordinary, insignificant life, but one which they
will enjoy.
