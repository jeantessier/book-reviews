Back in high school, I had to read the
_Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men_, but I had never
read the first part of the book we had.  Now, in part out of curiosity and in
part out of nostalgia, I decided to take a look at it and maybe even re-read the
second discourse.  I wanted to see what I might have missed the first time
around.

---++ Discourse on the Arts and Sciences

Already, Rousseau has idea that man is fundamentally good and
that it is civilization that makes him bad.  He upholds his version
of virtue as above all else.  His version is grounded in service to
the community an putting the greater good to the group above
personal gain.  Anything else leads to inequities and all evils.

Rousseau's point-of-view reminds me of what I understand of
wahhabism in the islamic world.  Both praise an earlier state of
society where everything was better.  Both recommend letting go of
many modern concepts and inventions.  Simpler times called for
simpler ways and there were fewer opportunities for actions that
promote one person's interests at the expense of others.

The writing style relies on the reader having a strong foundation
of classical learning.  He often goes back to the Greek Antiquity
and the conflict between Athens and Sparta.  He is very critical of
scholasticism, but I guess it is normal for someone from the
Enlightenment to dismiss medieval thinkers.

The style of his responses is very interesting.  After going to
great lengths to explain why his works stands on its own, doesn't
need to be defended, and how his opponent didn't really disagree
with him in the end, he proceeds to dismantle the critic's opinions
one by one.

In this work, he recommends a serious study of the Scriptures as
all one really needs to lead a virtuous life and be mindful of
others.  His calvinistic roots are showing.  He does not address
other religions.  Are Hebrew or Muslim texts just as good for this
purpose as the Christian Bible?  And what about Eastern religions?
Maybe the thought didn't occur to him, immersed as he was in a
Christian world.

---++ Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men

The first discourse was drawing comparisons to ancient Greeks.
The second discourse goes on straight through to the most primitive
societies.  He is trying to paint a picture of man's _natural state_
from before he started living in society.

I keep comparing this text to Desmond Morris' _The Naked Ape_.
Rousseau keeps ranting about how people take their assumptions about
the way they live and put them on how people lived in the past.  He
chastizes other philosophers that put modern ideas in the head of
primitive men.  But he does not totally escape from the trap
himself.  In many places, his European bias shows.  And nowhere so
plainly as in his treatment of women.  They just don't factor in,
according to his views.  Morris had the benefit of 200 more years of
scientific thinking, a secular education (I think), and he could
count on the theory of evolution.  Rousseau has not of these things,
though he touches on how long it would have taken for the natural
man, barely more than an animal, to discover and develop the basic
tools for living in a society: language, building, fire,
agriculture, metal working, etc.

It also reminds me of Daniel Dennett's _Breaking the Spell_ where
he sees the development of religion and faith as an evolutionary
process.  Rousseau cannot articulate the impact of a small
differential over many generations, but his reasoning follows in the
same direction.

I think Rousseau idealizes the natural state a little too much.
The fact that he is an armchair naturalist, living in a tamed
European countryside, is obvious when he says things like how in
nature, no one is ever sick and that all creatures act with
moderation.  He does not consider the higher infant mortality rate
or the dangers of childbirth, to name just two.  I guess these
things didn't matter to 18th Century European minds.

But it is still amazing how he diverges from the accepted
thinkings of his days, specially those influenced by religion.  His
point-of-view is definitely humanistic.  At the time it was
published, it was yet another work that removed Man from center
stage and questioned his dominion over Nature.  No wonder his
contemporaries found it shocking.

Just as the first discourse laid the foundation for the second
one, this one lays the foundation in its turn for Rousseau's
_The Social Contract_.  I'm tempted to read that one, now.
