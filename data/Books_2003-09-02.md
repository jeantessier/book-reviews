I did a "UML Lite" presentation to introduce coworkers to UML a while back.  I
don't need my presentation anymore, now that I know this book exists;  I can
just point my coworkers to this book.  I browsed through it at the bookstore and
it hits the spot with good coverage of essential UML notation an also pointing
out what is "nice, but I've never had to use it, so don't bother."

I already have a whole shelf of UML books and I already know what minimal subset
I really need, so I didn't bother to buy the book.  But if I had to recommend
only one UML book, I'd be torn between Martin Fowler's _UML Distilled_ and this
one.
