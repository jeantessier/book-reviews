After reading a few articles by [[http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/][DHH]] on
[[https://m.signalvnoise.com/@dhh][Medium]], I figured I'd look at his books.

This book is about the corporate culture at [[http://37signals.com/][37signals]]
and how it differs from traditional top-down structures that try to plan
everything.  I was hoping it would resonates with what I experienced at Google.

Medium articles are great for a quick read that will introduce some new idea or
concept.  They are great for reading during the commute or during a short break.
But they don't work as well for me for going deep in a topic or for doing
long-form coverage, where the author can explore all aspects of a subject.  I
was hoping this book would be the authors' long-form into their ideas about
company culture.  Instead, I got what felt more like a quickly put together
collection of their Medium articles.  It gets a little rant-sy at times and
foaming-at-the-mouth, so to speak.  A lot of the advice goes against accepted
norms (which isn't bad in itself) but can come across as reckless.  There are
many instances where a little more context would help guide the reader, instead
of the generic
jump-in-the-deep-end-and-figure-it-out-it-will-be-okay-it-worked-for-me.

As the book wore on, the advice kept getting more and more anecdotal and
reckless.  The tiny chapter structure felt like the book suffered from ADHD.
The authors would simply spew out whatever they happened to think about a given
topic, without taking the time to think it through.

I like books that question preconceptions.  But I am less fond of books that
act like a Michael Crichton novel.  Crichton has a habit of taking a new-ish or
fringe idea and claiming that _all_ other opinions are ignorant and wrong
because he knows so much better.  This book sometimes felt like that.  The
authors have been successful with their method at 37signals.  But they only have
one data point on which to base their opinion.  How much of their success is
really due to their revolutionary insights versus just a stroke of luck?
Without repeating the experiment multiple times, you cannot really tell.
However, it is very easy to delude ourselves into thinking we are geniuses,
especially in the absence of contrary evidence.

Fried and DHH never really make a point.  They fire quick quips in rapid
succession, more in an attempt to drive something home than to shore it up.  It
doesn't mean their ideas are wrong, but the the constant pounding gets annoying
in the long run.
