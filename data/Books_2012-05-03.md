I really appreciated his two other books, Taliban and
[Descent into Chaos](#Descent_into_Chaos), for their deep knowledge
of the issues at stake in Afghanistan and Central Asia.  I was looking forward
to this update on things are evolving.

Things are not going well in _AfPak_.  Since American troops will leave
Afghanistan by 2014, everybody is pretty much waiting for them to have left
before they make their move.  The Afghan government is feeling isolated and
abandoned.  Pakistan wants to play a major role in shaping the future of
Afghanistan, which it sees as a strategic component of its strategy regarding
India, but it also has to deal with its home brand of islamist fundamentalists.
All the other neighbors are taking a wait-and-see attitude.  America is doing
its best to make a dignified exit.

The last pages of the book mention the accidental killing of 26 Pakistani
soldiers in a NATO air strike on 2011-11-26.  This prompted Pakistan to close to
supply routes into Afghanistan.  On 2012-05-21, the news mentioned a NATO summit
where they were talking about these closed supply routes.  Six months after the
incident, the issue is still not resolved.

On 2012-05-23,
[Pakistan convicted the doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jrph4TaxnPQbRXQyE-J630WjOM-Q?docId=4785f8c699964efea7e1288c82f61b05).
Just like Ahmed Rashid mentions in the book, Pakistani officials are more
concerned with the breach of their sovereignty by the US raid to kill bin Laden
than with the fact he was being given shelter in Pakistan.  On 2012-05-24, the
US

in retaliation, and on 2012-05-25,
[US lawmakers called Pakistan "terrorist state", "schizophrenic ally"](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/US-lawmakers-call-Pakistan-terrorist-state-schizophrenic-ally/articleshow/13492994.cms).

I'm afraid Rashid's next book on the region, in a few years, after the American
withdrawal, will be quite depressing.

On 2021-09-07, an article came out in
[The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-other-afghan-women)
looked at the plight of Afghan women in rural areas.  It describes how tribal
traditions are keeping women in their house.  They even prevented early efforts
by the Russians to emancipate and educate women.  During the American
occupation, women in the cities had much more freedom, but it was a different
situation in rural areas.  Now, the Americans have withdrawn and the Taliban has
taken over again.
