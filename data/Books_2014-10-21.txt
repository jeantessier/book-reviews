First novel by a friend of mine from college.  We both studied computer science
and then had long careers in software.  Now, he's written and self-published his
first novel using [[http://lulu.com/][lulu.com]].

The novel suffers from all the ailments you'd expect from a first-time writer.
I had several issues with both style and substance.

The basic plot is a teenage high school drama with a shy but smart protagonist,
a sparky and empathic love interest, a courtyard bully, and inept adults.  The
core story deals with the reclusive Daniel coming out of his shell and taking
an active part in his life instead of just observing it.  He gravitates towards
highbrow subjects in an effort to make himself interesting, but only comes off
as shallow.  This extends to his relations with other characters where he shows
a total inability to stay in a conversation that does not go precisely as he
wants.  He consistently overreacts to the slightest contradiction.

The plot attempts to introduce a murder investigation, but the characters only
have a vague rumor to go on.  This subplot is totally preposterous.  The reader
and characters have nowhere near enough information to build a credible theory
of the crime.  The result is that the characters look either paranoid or stupid 
(or both) to the reader, making it difficult to identify with them.

Another subplot deals with suicide.  This is not the desperate form of suicide
as the only way to escape from an intolerable reality.  It is the depressed form
of suicide where death might offer a respite from the weight of everyday life.
The angle could have been interesting, but it is merely exposed and never
pursued any further.  There are numerous other philosophical questions that are
just dropped in and then go no further.  The effect is only pedantic.

The novel spends its first 90% setting up characters and a mood only to throw it
all away in the last 10%.  It goes in a totally different direction that bears
little to no resemblance to the novel that preceded it.  I felt cheated.  I had
worked real hard to like the novel up to that point, in spite of all its flaws.
I had to throw all that away and try again from scratch.

Lastly, I have two issues with his writing style.  The overall writing suffers
from wordiness.  Right from the first paragraph

<blockquote>

La cloche retentit.  Un murmure se fait graduellement entendre, tel un troupeau
lointain qui s'approche &agrave; grands pas.  Le sol vibre comme pour avertir
une proie de l'approche imminente de pr&eacute;dateurs en furie.  Les hauts
murs, partiellement habill&eacute;s de casiers en m&eacute;tal,
r&eacute;fl&eacute;chissent le bourdonnement pour en amplifier la cacophonie.
Le brouhaha envahit soudainement la grande salle.  Les corridors, tels des
volcans en &eacute;ruption, crachent des &eacute;tudiants par dizaines.

</blockquote>

Which roughly translates to:

<blockquote>

The bell rings. A murmur is heard gradually, as a distant herd is approaching
briskly. The floor vibrates as if to warn a prey of the impending approach of
raging predators. The high walls, partially dressed in metal lockers, reflect
the buzz to amplify the cacophony. The hubbub suddenly invades the main hall.
The corridors, like volcanoes that are erupting, spew students by the tens.

</blockquote>

Each sentence evokes multiple clashing images and only confuse the reader.  One
sentence has a _herd_ as the source of the noise, and the next sentence has
_predators_ as the source.  Predators don't move in herds, so the mind of the
reader would not normally make the connection.  Next, we have three different
words very close to each others to describe the sound of the approaching crowd.
The mind just spins.  From herds to preys to predators to metal-dressed to noise
to volcanoes.  And all for just a few tens of students.  At the end of it all,
I'm left underwhelmed.

My second issue with the style is when the characters are speaking.  The action
takes place in a Montreal suburb, so the characters inject some local flavor in
their speech patterns.  But it is very inconsistent.  Sometimes, they'll drop in
and out of the vernacular within a single paragraph.  People don't talk like
that.  In a given conversation, it's all in or all out.  I really enjoyed the
attempt at local flavor, which made it even more annoying when it was erratic.

I'm gonna stop here, now.  The author is a good friend and I don't want to
overdo the harping.  I'm glad he actually got a novel out and I'm excited to see
how he will evolve as a writer.
