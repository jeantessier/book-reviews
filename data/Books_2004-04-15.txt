In this novel, the main character searches for the Holy Grail by following clues
in Leonardo Da Vinci's artwork.

I've already read a fair bit about the Knights Templars and grail quests.  It's
been done before.  Usually better.  I still think the best novel around these
conspiracy theories is still Umberto Eco's
_[[http://amzn.com/0151327653][Foucault's Pendulum]]_.  Eco's characters obsess
about as much about wild conspiracy theories, but at least they get grounded
once in a while.

The characters in _The Da Vinci Code_ weave complex, omnipresent conspiracy
theories that fit within Western Christian culture, but fails to take into
account some of the other major contributors to Western thought, such as Judaism
and Islam.  It bugged me.  That, plus the fact that he placed the action in
Paris for effect and uses cute little French sentences to charm the reader.  The
problem is that real French people from Paris would not speak like that.  In at
least one case, it was a direct translation of an American idiom.  Mr. Brown,
you are just plain silly.  By the way, at one point he refers to the Hopi
language word _Koyaanisquatsi_, meaning "life without balance".  It is the title
of an amazing movie by Godfrey Reggio, which Reggio admitted he invented from to
Hopi words: _koyaanis_ for "out of balance, falling" and _qatsi_ for "life,
existence".  The Hopi would combine words to signify concepts, but not the
combination _koyaanisqatsi_, which the director invented for his movie's
purpose.  He said so during a panel discussion on the DVD for his other film
_Naqoyqatsi_.
