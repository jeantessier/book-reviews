I work there now.  I started at Google at the end of August
2005, right about the time the book ends.  What's more, I came to
the Bay Area in 1999, around the same time that Google started
really taking off.  I still remember the first time a friend
mentioned Google to me, a new search engine that had a new page
ranking system.  I wasn't convinced at first and it took me a few
years before I finally switched to Google for my web searches.
Old habits die hard.

As I read through the book, going through the years, I could
compare what was happening at Google to what I was doing at the
time.  What was I doing wherever instead of being where the action
was at?

The authors are clearly big fans of Google and Larry and Sergey.
At times, they are clearly gushing, including the parts about Larry
and Sergey's childhood.  But overall, the book is very informative
and clearly relates the spirit of innovation and caring that is the
Google culture.
