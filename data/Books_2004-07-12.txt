The author builds up a case that shows how English-speaking
Canadians have persecuted the French-speaking population from even
before the Conquest in 1763.  Throughout Canada's history, the
British colonial powers have repeatedly tried to remove this
troublesome population of former French nationals that does not want
to disappear from the face of the Earth quietly.

I thought at times the author was piping his own horn.  There
are definitely places where he reads much more into what some
writers are saying than a normal person would.  But one cannot deny
the documented historical events that show dogged determination of
WASPs in getting rid of everyone else.

Like Michael Moore, you must take this book with an appropriate
amount of salt.  It is an opinion piece by its author and one must
read it in that light.  Nonetheless, the work is very well
documented and is a great refresher course in Canadian history,
even if it focuses on all the not-so-great aspects of it.
