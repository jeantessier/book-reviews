Best book ever.

I bought an English translation for the kids, until they can read the original
in French.  I'm reading it to Vincent as I try to get the rhythm right.  This
translation is okay, but it's still a little awkward around the edges.
_Little fellow_ doesn't have the same familiar cuteness as the French
_petit bonhomme_.  But it is to be expected that a translation will never be
exactly like the original.

This book is about friendship and what's important in life and it is also about
death and loss.  It tackles very deep issues with disarmingly simple language.
It is very modern in its approach by paring things down to the absolute
essential but at the same time using poetic elements to convey strong emotions
succinctly.

I don't know that the kids are old enough to fully grasp the emotions expressed
in the book, or to go beyond the literal interpretation of its central message.
When I was a child, I didn't get the message either and it was only when I read
it again, much later, as an adult, that I could seize its full impact.  I hope
the same can happen to them; that they will appreciate the beautiful, simple
story and that they will want to revisit it when they're all grown up.

Curious factoid: my English translation states the original copyright as of 1943
whereas my French edition shows the copyright as of 1946.
