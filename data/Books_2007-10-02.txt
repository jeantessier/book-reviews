Irshad came to give a talk at Google and they were handing out
her book.  The talk was engaging and I decided to read the book to
see more of what she had to say.

It is really nice to see a perspective of Islam from the inside.
Irshad questions many aspects of her religion but wants to hold on
to it, so she seeks answers that can reconcile her with it rather
than turn her away from it.  It is very personal and thought
provoking.

Towards the end, she touches upon the concept of
_individuality_, the ability for each one of us choose who
we want to be and contribute to society, each in our own way.  This
resonates with a feeling I had at previous jobs where I felt I
didn't have to toe the party line all the time as long as I was
being constructive most of the time.  There are always those who
feel that everybody must accept the mindshare all the time and who
believe in conformity instead of diversity of ideas.
