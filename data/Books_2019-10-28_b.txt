The absolute, best reference for all things
[[https://rubyonrails.org/][Ruby on Rails]]!  It is _very_ comprehensive.  If
you want to know all that is possible with a given command or piece of code,
this is the place to go.

One drawback, however, is that you pretty much need to understand Rails already.
This is not an introduction for people who are completely new to Rails.  But
once you grasp the concepts and you have an idea of what you want to do, this
book will take you the rest of the way.
