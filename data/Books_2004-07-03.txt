Isaac Asimov's seminal novel about robots and how they behave.
This is a collection of short stories that document the evolution
of robotic technology in the world of tomorrow and the societal
changes they trigger.

I started reading it in preparation for the
[[http://imdb.com/title/tt0343818/][movie]], knowing full
well that the movie has nothing to do with the book, except for the
title.  I had bought the novel a long time ago, because it's a
classic, and figured I'd read it someday.  So that day has finally
come.

The book is a collection of short stories that were published
between 1940 and 1950.  In is interesting to see how the author
looked at political development in the future, how in the end,
there is a large russo-american block that dominates the planet and
an old, decadent Europe that is now good for nothing.  Luckly,
things didn't pan out that way (yet), but it gives us an insight in
how they saw the world back then and where they saw it going.  It
is also curious how to them, atomic energy would become ubiquitous
in the future, like in George Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ and Ray Bradbury's
_Fahrenheit 451_.
