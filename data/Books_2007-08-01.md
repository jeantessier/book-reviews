The entire book can be reduced to two slides: one diagram and
one bullet list of pros and cons.  The diagram shows up again and
again; they use it as a map to the contents, highlighting the
current section.  Each time, the diagram takes about three quarters
of the page.  It is not a very busy diagram and it could easily
have been made smaller.

So far, it is very repetitive.  They keep repeating the same
things over and over.  They keep promising that topics will be
covered in more depth in later chapters, but I am still waiting.

In the end, the whole book could be reduced to that one diagram
and a short bullet list of pros and cons.  I was pretty
disappointed.  But if you need to sell a continuous build to
someone who is not technical and does not understand programming,
maybe this is a book for that.
