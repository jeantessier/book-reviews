I've been working on a "UML Lite" presentation to introduce
coworkers to UML.  I need it no longer; I can just point them to
this book.  I browsed through it at the bookstore and it hits the
spot with good coverage of essential UML notation an also pointing
out what is "nice, but I've never had to use it, so don't bother."

I already have a whole shelf of UML books and I already know what
minimal subset I really need, so I didn't bother to buy the book.
But if I had to recommend only one UML book, I'd be torn between
Martin Fowler's _UML Distilled_ and this one.
