'The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.'

From the blurb at the back of the book, I thought it would be a discussions of
generalists versus specialists, with Tolstoy as an example.  That was not quite
it.

First, Berlin admits right off the bat that the metaphor may be a bit of a
stretch.

<blockquote>

Of course, like all over-simple classifications of this type, the dichotomy
becomes, if pressed, artificial, scholastic and ultimately absurd.

What started as a parlor trick: find an arbitrary criteria and use it to
partition a group of people, is a mere pretext to introduce a lengthy discussion
of Tolstoy and how his philosophy is expressed in _War and Peace_.  The metaphor
can still be useful when it provides a new dimension with which to explore a
topic.  But in Berlin's case, it has become he's best-known contribution.  It
felt like Frankenstein and his monster, where the creation takes over the life
of its creator.

I haven't read _War and Peace_, but I did see the 2016 BBC production, so at
least I was able to follow somewhat what Berlin was talking about.  Tolstoy had
a view of history similar to calculus: the force driving history is the integral
of an infinite number of insignificant events.  Any attempt to reduce it to
specific actors or events is futile.  Tolstoy showed great genius at destroying
such attempts at reduction, but he was never able to resolve the integral to
reveal what drives history.  It got me thinking of chaos theory and strange
attractors.  It also got me thinking of the movement of electrons in a
conductive material, where they bounce around between atoms somewhat at random
but overall _slowly_ drift in the direction of the electric current.

Berlin contends that Joseph de Maistre was a big influence on Tolstoy.  He had
the same contempt for highfalutin intellectuals and also believed in a higher
power.  Only, his was the Catholic Church.

They both agreed that warfare is an intrinsically unpredictable.  This quote by
Maistre:

<blockquote>

Vaincre, c'est avancer.  Mais quel est celui qui avance? c'est celui dont la
conscience et la contenance font reculer l'autre.

Indicates that the winner is the one whose determination is stronger than the
others and puts them on the defensive.  Much like in kendo.

The appendix confirms my impressions that Berlin can be a little long-winded.
Like when he uses the word _circumambient_.  (Incidentally, it's the title of a
song by Grimes)

I received this book as part of a White Elephant book exchange at work.  I'm
glad that I learned a lot while reading it, but I'm still a little disappointed
that my early expectations of a discussion of generalists versus specialists
weren't met.
