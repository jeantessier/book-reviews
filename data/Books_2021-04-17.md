I was looking for some light reading, so I figured I'd catch up with the story
of [_The Hunger Games_](#The_Hunger_Games).

Stylistically, it follows in the same vein as the first book.  At the beginning,
Katniss is very moody and overly sensitive.  She keeps going on describing
clothes and food.  I got annoyed by the little phrases the author used to
summarize the previous novel, as if anyone would read this book without having
read it.  Or, at least, seen the movie.

Katniss and Peeta are quite innocent when they sleep in the same bed and are
using the rumors that crop up around them.  The book makes it sound plausible
when it tries to explain Katniss' repressed libido due to her past trauma.  And
maybe Peeta is the same.  Still, they are two 17-year olds, and I feel it's
pushing it.  I know this is YA for an American audience, but still!!  At least,
once in the arena, they get to share one passionate kiss.

Once they get in the arena, the action starts driving the story forward and
Katniss becomes less annoying.  The author did a good job of portraying the
limited education in the districts, such as when Katniss doesn't know about CPR,
or when no one really understands Beetee's plan.
