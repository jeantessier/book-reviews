Quickly read through it, skimming most of the non-puzzle stuff
and skipping the language-specific section altogether.

Fine for college grads in their first interviews.  The questions
were too simple to really assess a candidate to a senior position.
Nice sample of interview puzzles, though.

I keep recommending it to people who need to prepare for
technical interviews.
