Malcolm Gladwell was giving a talk at my office.  He was very
lively and a great speaker.  He had some ideas that seemed
controversial, or at least outside the mainstream.  He definitely
piqued my curiosity.  I got the book for free, but now I might just
go out and buy his previous book too.
_(As a follow up, someone did give it to me as a Christmas 2005 present.)_

Malcolm Gladwell deals with subjects from the world of science,
but he is a preacher at heart.  He cites the works of others, but
only papers that support his position.  He does not present a
balanced view of the topics and you have to take him at his word
that his experts are at the top of their field.

The scientific approach shows all the evidence, even the
contrary one, and builds a theory that encompasses all data.  It
lets you come to your own conclusions, based on the evidence.
Science requires unbiased knowledge.  A preacher, by opposion, asks
that you accept his opinion at face-value.  He presents a single
point of view and holds it as the unquestionable truth from then
on.  His job is simply to convince you that he is right.  Preaching
only requires faith, which has a lower burden of proof.  As I read
the book, I felt that it asked for more faith in the author and his
ideas rather instead of offering comprehensive and unbiased
knowledge about the issues, and it did bother me a bit.

The book still made for a very good read.  The ideas are
definitely stimulating and can prompt you to reconsider the weight
you place on first impressions.
