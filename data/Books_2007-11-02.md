A little bit foaming at the mouth and decidedly one-sided.
Hitchens goes to great length to describe all that is wrong with
religion but does not really take the time to compile some of what
is right with it.  I think there would still be more bad than good,
but his argument would be that much stronger if it appeared like he
had done _all_ his homework.

Hitchens makes an argument that religion was useful during the
infancy of our species, but we've outgrown the need for it.  We
invented stories to explains things when we had no better
explanation, but now science and philosophy have given us tools to
help us understand the universe much better.

He includes references to Daniel Dennett and his
[Breaking the Spell](#Breaking_the_Spell).
He also makes me want to read Bertrand Rusell, now.  While I was
reading the book, I watched some of his videos on
[YouTube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=sD0B-X9LJjs) and I
ended up watching others by Sam Harris.  He has an interesting
point of view too.
