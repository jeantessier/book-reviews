Second reading.  I first read this book while in highschool.

Lots of possible allegories is possible, here.  Each character
clearly illustrates some concept that was important to Mishima.

Now that I have become more familiar with Japanese culture
through kendo, I was better able to appreciate the novel.  Truly
a masterpiece.
