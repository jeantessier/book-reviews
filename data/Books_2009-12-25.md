A very hasty re-read during the holidays.  I skipped some of the more boring
parts and focused on exposition about the main gimmick of the series: the
paratwa.

First one best of the lot.  Others are typical three-act story: first act is
self-contained.  Second act expands on the first and sets up the third.  Third
act tries to explain everything, wrap up all arcs, and has unexpected twists.
