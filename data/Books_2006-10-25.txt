I borrowed a copy from work to take a quick look.  The first 100
pages are a quick walkthrough of the language itself.  The next 200
pages cover the extensive libraries and the index is about 50 pages
long.

The book gives a brief, if hurried, introduction to Python.  If
you are already familiar with programming, and specialized
scripting languages, this should give you what you need to start
writing Python scripts.  Like Java, real mastery hinges on thorough
knowledge of the libraries.

The language is ugly, like Perl, but has many interesting
features.  It has slightly more elaborate data structures for
quickly organizing data, and support for object-oriented
programming is less haphazard.  Still, some of the underpinnings
are exposed and not always graceful, like prefixing methods with
=%5F%5F= to mark them private.  It's a step up from Perl,
but not what I would call elegant or even readable.

I know there is a

out by now.  I'm curious as to what's been added since 2001.
