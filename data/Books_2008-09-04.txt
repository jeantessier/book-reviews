I learned about this book while reading [[#Clean_Code][Clean Code]] by
Robert C. Martin.  Since it is written by Kent Beck, I just had to read it.

This book and [[#Clean_Code][Clean Code]] by Robert C. Martin have a lot in
common but address it in different ways.  While the later is more practical
with lots of examples and case studies, this one reads more like
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FBook%5Fof%5FFive%5FRings][The Book of Five Rings]]:
here's a piece of advice, go think about it carefully.
