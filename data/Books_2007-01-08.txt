A friend gave me this book in 1990 and I really enjoyed it.  It
still stands out as a gift that was totally unexpected, totally not
the kind of book I would have gone for, and yet it was an amazing
experience to read this book and discover its story.  The other
Friday, I was just looking for a movie to go to and discovered
quite by accident that they had made a movie of it.  I immediately
called a buddy of mine who had read the book in high school in
Germany and we hurried down to the cineplex to see it.  The movie
was fabulous and made me want to read the book again.

I got interrupted halfway by having to read another book for
work.  Luckily, this didn't take too long.

Wow!  What a treat.  This novel just blows your mind.  It is
very original in the way it presents an otherwise banal story.
S&uuml;skind does a great job of bringing to life the world of
Rennaissance perfumers and life in Paris at that time.  I really
like how the author describes each and every scene mainly through
its smells.  This is a novel about the sense of smell and
S&uuml;skind does a great job of awakening us to all the smells
that surround us every day.  And of course, he chose a setting that
must have been rich in smells of all kinds: mid-18<sup>th</sup>
Century France, and Paris especially.  And one funny tibbit:
S&uuml;skind seems to take pleasure in killing off the majority of
his secondary characters the moment they leave the story.  This
works particularly well in the movie, turning it into a kind of
dark comedy.  The main subject is dark enough that these moments of
tragi-comedy are most welcome and lighten the mood a little
bit.

One problem I had with the book was how the author avoided the
Seven Year War by making Grenouille sleep through it in a cave in a
remote area of France.  Now granted the character needed the period
of inner development and the author needed to skip a period of
European history that would have greatly reduced the mobility of
his character, but still.  _He slept in a cave for seven years._
Come on!  Luckly, the novel picks up from there.

I find it interesting that the movie softened Grenouille
somewhat.  In the movie, he appears as a simple soul with one
obsession who is rather oblivious to the human cost of his
enterprise.  In the novel, Grenouille is much darker and actually
arbors a deep hatred for humanity.  It is interesting that the
director figured that audiences would react better to a variation
on Forest Gump than one of Hannibal Lecter.
