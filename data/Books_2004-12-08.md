eXtreme Programming 2.0.

Actually, it's a complete rewrite of the first edition.

Actually, it's more like reinventing XP.  Kent Beck is adjusting
XP so we can benefit from his additional five years of XP
experience.  The first XP was squarely aimed at programmers; this
new version should appeal to everyone involved in software
development.  The practices have been updated: some have been
dropped, some are new.  He recommends a much more gradual
introduction if you want to move to XP, instead of the strong push
from the first edition.  He is also much more explicit about ways
to customize XP to your circumstances.

Like Tom DeMarco's _Peopleware_ and Alistair Cockburn's
_Agile Software Development_, he reminds us that software is
written by people.  But he goes further, showing how XP brings back
humanity to those who practice it.

Still a quick read and very inspirational.  Plus, the
bibliography at the end has many of my favorite authors and
titles.
