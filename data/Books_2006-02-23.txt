Goes back and forth between highfalutin pop psychology and
science fiction.  The reader must remember that the author is not a
philosopher by training.

Part of the problem, for me, is that at first, the book asks you
to challenge your assumptions, but then presents a farfetched model
that can be neiher proven nor disproved and asks you to accept it
wholesale.

It's a nice exercise at challenging assumptions and trying to
prove absurd things just for the sake of logical argument.
