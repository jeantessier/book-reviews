Another funny comic book from Sarah Andersen.  It pokes fun at all the monsters
people have been trying to photograph over the years.  There is a funny one
where they try to take a group selfie, but scatter as the shutter releases.
There is some romance-oriented jokes, like ghosts getting married 'until death
do us part' and a siren going on a date with Siren Head.
