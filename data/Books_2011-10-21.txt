I vaguely remember reading this book a long time ago, but I cannot recall who
had recommended it.  I liked the movie adaption.

This short novel has amazing rhythm.  When the main character is in Europe, the
prose is quick, light, with few details.  When he is in Japan, things slow down.
And when the _woman with the face of a girl_ is present, time seems to stand
still and he becomes hypersensitive to the slightest details.  The text is
brilliant as much for what is said as for what is not said.  The reader is made
to feel what Herv&eacute; Joncour is feeling.  In Europe, things are mundane and
expected; they hardly need mentioning; they certainly don't deserved getting
excited over them.  In Japan, everything is different, every detail counts;
Herv&eacute; Joncour bristles with anticipation.

And the transitions are marvelous little gems in their own rights.  I love how,
when Herv&eacute; Joncour travels eastward, the descriptions have a familiar
structure but with slight variations each time.  The return travels are more
quickly dispatched, but still evolve ever so slightly as the novel progresses.
It's like listening to music by Philip Glass: the notes keep repeating
themselves but the melody is slowly evolving and you can't help but wonder where
it will lead you.

This sense of rhythm was completely lost in the movie, but it made up for it
with beautiful imagery.  The book is an amazing read.
