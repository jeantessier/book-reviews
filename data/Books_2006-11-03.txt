I read this book when it came out and recently I felt the urge to
read it again.  I remembered bits and pieces, but large chunks are
missing.

Once again, Kundera is exploring the human psyche using strongly
typed characters that exemplify the aspects he wants to cover.  This
one is interesting in that the author is himself a character in the
novel.  He starts by describing how he got the idea for his main
character, fleshes it out with secondary characters, and by the
time we reach the end, he is actually meeting the characters
himself.  You have to read it to really appreciate it.

There are many clusters of characters.  Agn&egrave;s and Paul and
Laura and Bernard (the nature of relationships).  Goethe and
Bettina (the pursuit of fame and immortality).  Goethe and
Hemmingway in the afterlife (on the consequences of fame and
immortality).  Rubens (the pursuit of sex).  Kundera and Professor
Avenarius (futility).
