I'm taking a second, deeper look at it.  I borrowed a copy from
a coworker and I read it through this time.

Great, short intro to minimalist UML.  This is followed by a
quick review of OOD principles; they are covered at greater length
in is other book: "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns,
and Practices", but the quick review is still good.  He ties it all
together with two case studies, including his now recurring SMC
compiler.

Quick to read, loads of good stuff.  Lots of editing mistakes
also, they should hire a new editor.  He also suggests people use
JDepend when he talks about dependency management.  I beg to differ.
People should be using [[http://depfind.sourceforge.net/][Dependency Finder]]
instead.  :-)
