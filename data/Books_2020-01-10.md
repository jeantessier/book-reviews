Much like [_The Story of Kullervo_](#The_Story_of_Kullervo), but this
time Tolkien is delving into an obscure Breton myth.  He draws from short poems
about _corrigan_, Brittany's version of faeries, and the tricks they pull on
humans.  Tolkien builds on this material to weave a tale of a childless couple
making a deal with mythical agents with disastrous results.

It is very interesting to see Tolkien evolves his fable through various
iterations and how he tries different wordings and archaic forms.

_Aotrou_ and _Itroun_ are simply titles in Breton meaning lord and lady
respectively.  The story's characters are never named and refer to one another
by their title.
