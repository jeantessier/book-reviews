For the most part, it is a rewrite of _[[#Rework][Rework]]_.  Like other books
by Fried and [[http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/][DHH]], it is very
lightweight and based solely on their experience with Basecamp.  They have some
interesting ideas, but these are so specific to what the authors have been
fortunate enough to experience at their one company that it is hard to see how
they could also be applicable to anyone else.
