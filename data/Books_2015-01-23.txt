Responsive web pages are all the rage these days.  I figured this book could
help me make sense of it all.

In the end, I couldn't help but be disappointed.  Carver, the author, tries to
straddle the divide between designers and programmers but the book is too short
to be helpful to either.  The design insights are too few and too high-level.
The technical insights are either too trivial or would require better exposition
to show their internal structure and explain their tradeoffs.

For example, the section on design patterns was a missed opportunity to
illustrate multiple related patterns and to show how they resolve forces in
different ways.  The reader would have had a better perspective of the solution
space and how to navigate it.  Instead, we get two measly patterns and no clear
discussion of why or when one might be more beneficial than the other.  A
footnote points to a website of responsive design patterns, but the site is not
well suited to side-by-side comparison.

Carver uses an interesting device of having sidebars for designer-specific and
developer-specific advice.  In these sidebars, he can raise the level for these
audiences.  The unfortunate side effect is that, by comparison, the main text
appears condescending to both.

There were some nuggets here and there.  Modernizr and Foundation look like good
tools to have under your belt.  But it missed other opportunities to discuss
emerging technologies like Bootstrap and Purecss under the excuse that
frameworks can constrain and stifle your creativity.  It smells of
_Not Invented Here_ syndrome to me.  Or maybe the editor didn't want to
undermine the potential for new titles on these technologies.
