Gideon Sterer worked with me as an intern a long time ago.  This book for young
readers is a cute concept and it has nice illustrations.  At one point, the text
reads "with broad shield and heavy sword," but it would have felt more natural
to be as "with broad swords and heavy shield."  Maybe I've been reading too much
Homer.
