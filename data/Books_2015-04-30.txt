Insignificance has a negative connotation, but Kundera sets out to write a
_celebration_ of insignificance.  He shows us how things that are insignificant
to the group can be important to the individual: the small thoughts that matter
only to us and are unique to each of us.  In the day to day, we concerns
themselves with things that matter to us in the moment but that are not that
important in the long term, and usually, we're the only ones who care.

Each character in the novel has their own preoccupation.  It generates deep
thoughts in them in private, but reveal their insignificance when they are
shared with others.  Alain never really knew his mother and thinks a lot about
his place in the world.  Caliban invents a fake Pakistanese identity that only
amuses him.  An imaginary Staline takes pleasure in abusing Kalinin, but he's
the only one who knows about it.

At the other extreme, La Franck is vain and shallow.  She tries to make an
insignificant moment profound for others to prop herself up, but it falls flat
and she leaves.

There is a dialog towards the end that I feel is key.  The characters discuss
how you don't get to pick your looks, your gender, where you were born, when you
were born, your mother; yet these factors are critical to how your life will
unfold.  Next to them, all the other _human rights_ that we think are so
important are really futile.
