A collection of satyrical cartoons about brand management.  Not quite as
disfunctional as Dilbert, it is written from an insider's perspective.  And
whereas Scott Adams is very critical of the corporate culture that he had to
endure, Tom is very much in love with brand management and he takes us on a tour
of its quirky landscape.

Each page shows one cartoon in the top half and Tom provides some commentary in
the bottom half.  The commentary are interesting when they talk about the
inspiration for a given cartoon, but too often they simply explain the cartoon
for the audience.  I'm tempted to say that if a cartoon needs explanation, then
it is a failed cartoon.  Unless you're being exclusive like
=[[http://xkcd.com/][xkcd]]=,
[[http://www.tomfishburne.com/tomfishburne/2010/03/sxsw-talk-innovation-lessons-from-cartooning.html][as Tom explains on his blog]],
in which case the point is for the cartoon *not* to be understood by the general
public but only by the limited community it targets.  Again,
cartoon + explanation becomes a losing proposition.

Nevertheless, it's a clever little book and a nice way to kill some time.  And
you get to learn something about marketing and brand management at the same
time.

I like this cartoon about

products.  I agree that they are better for you, but it saddens me that the
lower economic classes cannot afford them.  If it's better for you and will keep
people healthy, then it should be made available to everybody.  Keeping all of
society healthy is better for the overall economy than catering only to the rich
and dealing with the sick poor.
