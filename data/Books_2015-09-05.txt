I started learning about AngularJS and did one quick tutorial.  I was looking
forward to learning more through this book.

Fact: the book came out in July 2015.  Fact: the oldest message on the
[[https://forums.manning.com/forums/angularjs-in-action][Manning forum for the book]]
dates back to [[https://forums.manning.com/posts/list/30428.page][2013-03-20]].
Fact: the book is about AngularJS 1.0.  Fact: AngularJS 2.0 was announced in
September 2014.

Fact: the book is very short at 152 pages and 10 pages of appendices.  Fact: the
book starts well enough, with chapters 1 through 4 elegantly presenting the
major parts of AngularJS, but the second half feels rushed and is very hard to
understand.

Here is what I think happened.  In late 2012 or early 2013, Manning decided to
produce a book on AngularJS.  Almost two years into the project, the AngularJS
team threw them a curveball with a new incompatible AngularJS 2.0.  Manning had
to choose between scraping the work so far or rush to have it come out before
AngularJS 2.0.  They must have chosen the latter, which would explain both the
slimness of the book and the rushed feeling in the second half.

I really appreciated the first four chapters and the way they introduced the
various parts of AngularJS.  But already by chapter 4, there were bits of
complex code involving =$http= and promises that were just talked over instead
of really explaining to the reader what is happening behind the scene.  These
are powerful concepts that programmers are going to want to use heavily and need
to understand thoroughly.  It got worse in the following chapters with
directives and animation.  I could read the code but I could not see the full
context and understand what else was possible.  The prose simply restated the
code in "plain English" and did not add anything.

The book could use some architecture diagrams that explain better how the pieces
fit together.  Especially sequence diagrams that would show who is called when
and by whom and in what context.  AngularJS is a _framework_ that calls the
programmer's code at the right moment.  Knowing the context is really important
so we can plug the right code in the right place.  I find myself writing this
criticism of Manning books more and more.

In the end, I cannot really recommend this book.  It is too thin to be useful as
a reference.  And it will become obsolete as soon as AngularJS 2.0 is finalized.
