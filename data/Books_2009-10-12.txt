The books open with this passage:

<blockquote>

If no one asks me about it, then I know what it is; but if someone asks me about
it and I try to explain it to him, then I do not know what it is.

<footer>St. Augustine</footer>
</blockquote>

I just love Patrick S&uuml;skind.

The opening quote is about _time_.  S&uuml;skind co-opts it to talk about
_love_.  When I first read it, I thought it applied equally well to good
programming.  I think it really applies to any process of the mind that is
deeply grounded in our personal experience.  Each one of us has certain thoughts
that we understand intuitively, through our unique experiences.  When we try to
explain these thoughts to someone else, we fail utterly because we cannot reason
objectively about them and the other does not share our experiences.

This book is _very_ short.  Too short, actually.  He starts down a number of
promising avenues, but stops way too short.  And in the latter parts, he gives a
very one-sided opinion in his comparison between Orpheus and Jesus.  I would
have liked a slightly longer, more balanced exposition.  He can still come to
the same conclusions, but it would feel less forced.

I enjoyed reading the book.  It brings up interesting questions.  But I was left
wanting for more.  It felt a bit like a broken promise.
