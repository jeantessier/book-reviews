I was looking to approach [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
development from a TDD perspective, and seemed like a good way to do that.  It
builds up tests, one at a time, as it builds Rails artifacts.  It's all well and
nice, but Rails generators can bootstrap the process by generating specs
alongside Rails artifacts.  It's not quite test-_driven_, but it provides good
coverage with minimal effort.

I was focusing on learning Rails, so I was jumping around in the book, looking
up topics as I came across them.  I think the book benefits from a more
intentional reading that can make better use of its built-in narrative.

I will keep it close by as I work for when I need to dive deeper into a topic.
