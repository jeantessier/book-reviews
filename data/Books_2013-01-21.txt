Governments, especially 18<sup>th</sup> Century European governments, need an
enemy to focus public discontent away from themselves.  Simonini, the main
character, provides forged documents to assist one faction or the other in their
quest to hold on to power, as he lives through the Italian unification and later
the numerous troubles of Paris in that century.  A product of his age, he is a
misanthrope, a misogynist, an anti-semite, sometimes an anarchist, sometimes
pretending to be a freemason.  The novel wants to be a historical novel, where
the background and much of the action is grounded in actual history.  Simonini
is a thread that anchors the story through those tumultuous times and gives us a
unique point of view of all these secret services, secret societies, and
charlatans.  This allows Eco to weave Garibaldi, the Franco-Prussian War, the
Paris Commune, and even the Dreyfus Affair into the story, setting the stage for
20<sup>th</sup> Century events to come.

It took me a whole year to get through this novel, not because of it is
particularly dense (it is actually quite light for an Eco novel), but simply
because the main character is so antipathetic.  Eco went to great lengths to
make him as unlikeable as possible.  There is not one shred of humanity in him
that the reader can associate with, not even the gourmet eating, which is
lavishly described throughout.

---++ Diaries And Narrators

There are all kinds of characters involved in manipulating history from the
shadows.  Eco needs different narrators to help convey the principal archetypes.
Simonini is a forger, in it for the money.  Abb&eacute; Dalla Piccola is a
manipulating priest, led by a grand plan, a more noble ambition.  To help
transition between the two, there is an omniscient Narrator who can fill as
needed in the other to separate the other two narration, or humanize them by
letting them succumb to human frailties, such as confusion, or willful
forgetfulness, or fatigue.

---++ Unsatisfying, Gratuitous Sex Scene

As in _[[http://amzn.com/0544176561][The Name of the Rose]]_, we get a brief sex
scene between an inexperienced male and a lusting female.  We share the point of
view of the male, who is so overwhelmed that he gets utterly confused.  It is
awkward and totally misses on the sensuality of the moment.  I could have done
without.

---++ Open Ended

Eco uses an open ended narrative device to reinforce the role of the reader in
constructing the story for themselves.

Did the bomb explode?  Did Simonini die in the explosion?  Did Gaviali set him
up to extract revenge?  Was it Rachkovsky cleaning up loose ends and getting rid
of a potential witness, just as Simonini had done numerous times?  Or maybe
Simonini survived, somehow, and realizing the danger he is in, has gone into
hiding?  It is up to the reader to finish the story for themselves.

---++ Quotes

<blockquote>

Nothing is more original than something that's already been published.

<footer>somewhere between pages 331-378</footer>
</blockquote>

What he means is that when trying to convince people that a fake document is
genuine, it helps if the target audience is already familiar with the material.
Previously published material will strike a resonance in the reader's mind and
prime them to treat the new material as authentic.  Especially if the material
was published some time ago and the audience's recollection is a little fuzzy.
It will _feel_ right since it matches prior recollections.  Most people won't
go through the trouble of double checking.

<blockquote>

Most of those who join secret societies are opportunists who seek to make their
own way and have no worthy purposes.

This is said in the context of jews-are-infiltrating-secret-societies-as-part-of-their-plan-to-take-over-the-world.
What it means is that members of secret societies are looking for a sense of
purpose, which the leaders can provide and then use to manipulate the group and
get them to support the leaders' agenda, sometimes against their own best
interest.  Eco's character makes that statement about secret society membership,
but I think it can easily be applied to most organizations.
