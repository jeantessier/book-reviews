I've been curious about Hadoop for some time.  MapReduce is such an exciting
paradigm and I didn't get to do enough of it when I was at Google.  I tried to
use a 50% off coupon to buy this title directly from the publisher's website,
but ended up buying the ebook instead of the paper book.  It's great to have the
ebook so I can do searches in the text, but I cannot read an entire book on my
computer screen; so I had to buy it one more time to get the printed version.

One of the drawbacks of books on bleeding edge technologies is that by the time
you read the book, the examples need to be tweaked to get them to work.  Things
like =CLASSPATH= have changed and sometimes the interfaces are not exactly the
same.  In the book, they talk about _older_ Hadoop interfaces that were in use
until version 0.18, and _newer_ ones that were introduced in 0.20.  They decided
to keep all the examples in the _old_ style since all of Hadoop understands them.
I'm using version 0.21 to play with it, which is pretty much all moved on to the
_new_ interfaces.

A lot of the examples deal more with the details of running a Hadoop MapReduce,
and less with powerful ways to use the MapReduce paradigm.  Maybe the chapter on
"Advanced MapReduce" will fill my need.

I had to stop reading it half-way through because I had to read
[[#jQuery%5Fin%5FAction][jQuery in Action]] for work.  I will have to come back
to Hadoop at a later date.
