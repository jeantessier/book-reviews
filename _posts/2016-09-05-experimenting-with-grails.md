Created a Grails 3 app backed by MongoDB.  Couldn't get the GORM integration
quite right.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, so I'll keep picking at it some
more.

Also created another Grails 3 app, but backed by MySQL this time.  This one went
a lot smoother.

I can't get the Grails shell working under Grails 3.1.11.  It makes
experimenting with the data objects that much more difficult.
